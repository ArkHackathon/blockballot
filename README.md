Bitcamp 2018 Hack to create a blockchain voting system.

Fork of ARK to allow an election. Voting for the delegates to maintain blockchain nodes Since the infrastructure already allows voting for delegates, I am creating a python API to allow humans to create an ARK wallet associated with an ID. Then, the election agency(genesis wallet owner) can distribute the exact amount of coin necessary to submit a vote. The main change between use cases is the reward per block for maintaining a node. In a large system, like a government, this should be small or zero and delegates (new office holders) should instead be paid their government salary as incentive to maintain a node. In a smaller one, delegates and officials are more accountable to the community are a part of and so the solution to a reward for maintaining the blockchain is more nebulous. This is a factor for the group in question to decide. 

The illustrative case will be a UMD student group. For this group, members have to pay dues. They will pay the election administrator (genesis wallet owner) dues for the year to obtain coins and the administrator will be responsible for depositing these USD into the group treasury. As a reward for maintaining the nodes, the delegates for this group will not have to pay dues for the year.
